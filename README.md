# HackMIT Facial Detection Machine Learning Hackpack
This is a basic template for training a model with Tensorflow

## Usage
You can either clone this repo or save a copy of the jupyter notebook with [this colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/109vgEFb9I0YvAYaVxFv-KIDEZ_xI4uFP?usp=sharing). All code is located in `HackMIT_Hackpack_Facial_Detection_with_Webcam.ipynb`

## Description
The notebook `HackMIT_Hackpack_Facial_Detection_with_Webcam.ipynb` is a classic example of a computer vision project that trains a CNN to detect the presence of faces. The notebook walks through a step-by-step explaination of the problem, training data, CNN model architecture, and training and testing process. Within the notebook, you will learn how to visualize your data, create a Tensorflow model, use your webcam to test out your facial recognition model, and use the `.keras` extension to load and save your model. The notebook challenges you to think critically about the impact your machine learning project may have on its users, notice its bias, and improve upon the baseline model.
